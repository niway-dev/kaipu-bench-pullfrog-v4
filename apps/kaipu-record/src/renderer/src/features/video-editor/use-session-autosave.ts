/**
 * Debounced autosave of the video edit session.
 *
 * Before v2 the session was written only on export. `useBlocker` intercepts in-app
 * navigation and nothing else, so closing the window (⌘W, quit, a crash) silently threw
 * away every cut, every zoom and — the part that actually matters — every privacy
 * redaction the user had just drawn. See plans/video-editor-v2/07 and audit W11.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - a write is scheduled AUTOSAVE_DEBOUNCE_MS after the scene changes, never while a
 *     drag owns the scene (`interacting`) — one write per gesture, not per pointermove;
 *   - the pending write is flushed on unmount and on `beforeunload`;
 *   - `pendingRef` is true from the moment the scene changes until the write resolves;
 *     the page's navigation blocker reads it, so the discard dialog now means "a write
 *     is still pending or failed", not "you have edits";
 *   - `cancel()` drops the pending write — that is what the dialog's Discard button
 *     does, and it is what makes the dialog honest;
 *   - the header chip says "Saving…" only while a write is in flight. Between an edit and
 *     its write (a whole drag, then the debounce) it shows nothing: the owner read a chip
 *     that lit up on the first pointer move as "every change is saved immediately".
 *
 * The scene the editor OPENED with is never written back: opening a recording and
 * leaving must not create a session file (and must not turn a pre-v2 recording into a
 * v2 one just because the detector proposed some zooms).
