title: Image editor — infinite canvas and Inspect mode
description: The image editor becomes an infinite canvas whose export is the box around its content, saved as an editable document beside a flattened PNG. On top of it, one Inspect mode gives a loupe, the live color under the cursor, a ruler that measures pixel runs, pinned measurements, a step counter, a colors panel, and text recognition on macOS and Windows.

# Image editor — infinite canvas and Inspect mode — design

**Status: 🔵 Proposed · 2026-11-11.** Nothing in this document is built. Linear:
[NIW2-696](https://linear.app/niway/issue/NIW2-696/image-editor-infinite-canvas-and-inspect-mode-ruler-loupe-color).
ADRs: [0053](/architecture/decisions/0053-the-image-editor-is-a-canvas-saved-as-a-document-beside-its-flattened-export/),
[0054](/architecture/decisions/0054-inspection-tools-read-the-pixels-of-a-captured-image-inside-the-editor/),
[0055](/architecture/decisions/0055-text-recognition-is-a-port-served-by-the-os-engine-on-each-platform/).
Absorbs [NIW2-480](https://linear.app/niway/issue/NIW2-480/image-editor-keep-annotations-editable-with-a-sidecar-scene-instead-of)
and the analysis in [re-editable screenshots](/backlog/screenshot-scene-doc/).

## Summary (one minute)

Today the image editor shows one screenshot inside a beautify frame, and saving bakes every
annotation into a flat PNG (`annotations/scene.ts`, `annotations/compositor.ts`). Two things
change.

**The editor becomes a canvas.** A capture lands in the middle of an infinite, pannable
surface. Objects can sit outside the image and more images can be added. Copy and Save take
the **content box**: the smallest rectangle that contains every item, plus the beautify padding. One image alone exports
exactly that image, as today. The canvas is saved as a document (items plus the original
images) beside the flattened PNG, so a saved screenshot reopens with its objects still
editable.

**Inspect is one mode for pixel-perfect work.** Inside it a loupe and the color under the
cursor follow the pointer, `1` measures horizontally, `2` vertically, a click pins the
measurement as an object, and `C` copies the color. A colors panel lists every color in the
image and shows where each is used. Text recognition, served by the operating system's own
engine on macOS and on Windows, makes the text inside a screenshot selectable and offers
each text block as a target to hide.

| 4   | A redaction is destructive at save: its pixels are replaced in the stored asset, not only in the flattened PNG. The redact tool offers a **strong blur** (the default: the region is reduced to coarse blocks, then smoothed) and `solid`; the current light gaussian is retired, and a redaction made with it is saved as the strong blur. Only `solid` is documented as hiding content for certain, and the tool says so: the block averages of short, predictable text (digits, a known font) can be matched against rendered candidates. A block is at least 24 image pixels and at least a quarter of the region's shorter side, a starting value M3 tests. | Keeping the original image beside a blurred export keeps the secret on disk; the current gaussian blur is documented as reversible in `annotations/tools.ts`.                                                                                                            | 0053                             |

## Open questions

1. **Windows text recognition.** Whether `Windows.Media.Ocr` can be driven from a PowerShell
   script fast enough (target: under 1.5 s for a 1920×1080 image, cold) is not measured. M0
   measures it. ADR 0055 stays Proposed until then. If the spike fails, its Status line records it as rejected and a new ADR decides the backend before M8 starts.
2. **Mock.** The Inspect HUD and the canvas chrome need an approved picture before code. It
   is the first step of M1 and of M2, not part of this document.

## Out of scope

- Anything in the live capture overlay: no loupe, ruler or color readout while selecting.
- Points, logical units, or any unit other than image pixels.
- Detecting UI boxes (buttons, cards) as objects. Only text is recognized.
- Using recognized regions as zoom targets in the video editor. Separate spec, after M8.
- Exporting only the selected items or a named section of the canvas.
- Dragging an image file into the canvas from outside Kaipu.
- Scrolling capture, combining captures automatically, layout helpers (align, distribute).
- Cloud sync of the canvas document and assets. The flattened PNG keeps syncing as today.
- Linux. `screenshot-capture.ts` returns `unsupported` there.

## Failures this must protect against

These are risks, not observed incidents. Source: adversarial review by gpt-6.1-sol on
2026-11-11, judged against the repository.

- **A single image exports differently than today.** Size, pixels and beautify output must be
  byte-comparable with the current editor for a canvas holding one untouched image.
- **A document that cannot be read.** Corrupt JSON, a newer `schemaVersion` or a missing asset
  must fall back to editing the flattened PNG.
- **A secret left on disk.** After a redaction is saved, neither the stored asset nor the text
  cache may contain what it covered. `solid` guarantees that; the strong blur keeps one
  average color per block, so its minimum block size (decision 4) is what M3 must test.
- **A wrong hex.** Converting Display P3 to sRGB twice, or not at all, shows a color the
  designer did not choose. A translucent color reads as the composited result; the readout
  must not claim to recover the CSS value.
- **A run that is not the element.** Inside a button the scan stops at the label; a gradient
  stops it early; a borderless control has no edge. The tool must say what it measures, let
  the tolerance change, and let the user drag the endpoints.
- **Measuring the frame instead of the image.** A measurement taken over padding or empty
  canvas has no source pixel. Inspect only acts over an image item and stores endpoints in
  that image's pixel coordinates, so zoom and pan do not change the number.
- **Memory.** A 6144×3456 RGBA buffer is about 81 MiB before canvases and the export cache.
  One buffer per image, released when the image leaves the canvas.
- **A colors panel that freezes.** A photograph has millions of distinct colors; comparing
  every pair is quadratic. Quantize before grouping and run in a worker.
- **Keys that fire while typing.** `1`, `2`, `C` must be ignored in text fields and modal
  dialogs, as `annotation-layer.tsx` already does for Delete.
- **A helper that exists but fails.** Wrong architecture, timeout, malformed output. Each must
  end as "text recognition unavailable", never as a broken editor.
- **Step numbers after reopen.** With the document persisted, a reopened canvas continues at
  the next number; if the document was lost, numbering restarts at 1 over baked badges.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A canvas with one untouched image copies and saves a PNG with the same dimensions and
      pixels as the current editor produces for the same capture and beautify settings.
- [ ] Text placed outside the image is included in the exported PNG, and the export is the
      box that contains the image and the text.
- [ ] With two images on the canvas, the exported PNG is the box that contains both.
- [ ] Saving, closing and reopening an item shows its annotations selectable and movable.
- [ ] Deleting the canvas document from disk and reopening the item opens the flattened PNG.
- [ ] After saving a redaction, the stored asset shows the redacted pixels and the text cache
      has no word that intersected it.
- [ ] In Inspect mode the loupe shows unsmoothed pixels and the readout matches a fixture of
      known sRGB swatches exactly, and a tagged Display P3 fixture within one unit per channel.
- [ ] `C` copies the color in the selected format; the format switch offers hex, rgb, hsl, oklch.
- [ ] `1` and `2` show the horizontal and vertical run under the cursor in image pixels; the
      number does not change when the canvas is zoomed.
- [ ] A click pins the measurement; it appears in the exported PNG and can be moved after reopen.
- [ ] The step tool places badges numbered 1, 2, 3 in order; deleting one renumbers the rest.
- [ ] The colors panel lists the image's colors with their share; clicking one highlights
      where it appears in the image. A 5K photograph does not block the UI for more than 100 ms.
- [ ] On macOS and on Windows, dragging over recognized text selects it and copies it.
- [ ] Clicking a recognized text block in the redact tool hides exactly that block.
- [ ] With the helper removed, the editor opens and the text tools report unavailable.

## Milestones

One issue and one PR each, in this order. A milestone starts when the one it depends on is
merged. Every UI milestone adds its areas and states to `ui-map.ts` (ADR 0046).

Annotations keep their current shapes (`box`, `arrow`, `text`, `path`, `blur`) with coordinates
moved from "normalized to the shot" to world units. New kinds:

```ts
interface MeasureAnnotation {
  id: string; kind: "measure";
  imageId: string;              // the image it was measured on
  axis: "x" | "y";
  from: number; to: number;     // source pixels along the axis
  at: number;                   // source pixel on the other axis
  color: string;
}
interface StepAnnotation {
  id: string; kind: "step";
  x: number; y: number; color: string; size: number;
  // the number is the item's position among `step` items, not stored
}
```

A `measure` is anchored to its image: moving the image moves the measurement, and the label is
always `to - from` in that image's pixels.

**Content box.** The union of every item's bounds (stroke and label included), then the
beautify padding around it. With one image and nothing else this is the current output.
A gap between items takes the background, or a neutral solid when the background is `none`;
the padding itself stays transparent with `none`, as today.
Radius and shadow apply to each image item, the background to the whole box.

**Crop.** The crop tool becomes the export frame: a rectangle in world units that replaces
the content box. Items outside it are cut.

### 2. Storage

| File                               | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<id>.png`                         | Flattened export. Thumbnail, Copy, share, cloud. Always valid. |
| `.kaipu/<id>.canvas.json`          | The `CanvasDoc`.                                               |
| `.kaipu/<id>.assets/<assetId>.png` | Each image as it was added, minus baked redactions.            |
| `.kaipu/<id>.text.json`            | Recognized words per asset (M8).                               |

Open: load the document and assets; on any failure load `<id>.png` as a single image item.
Save: bake redactions into the assets, write assets and document, re-flatten `<id>.png`.
A baked redaction stays in the document as a locked item so it still draws, but its source
pixels are gone.

The quiet capture path (ADR 0042: capture and copy without opening the editor) writes only
`<id>.png`; the document is created the first time the item is opened in the editor.

**As built in M3 (NIW2-700).** Coordinates stay normalized to the base image until M6 adds a
second image; the base asset is `base.png`; the strong blur's block is
`max(24, ceil(min(w, h) / 4))` pixels. The details are in ADR 0053's Implementation status.

### 3. Inspect mode

Entered with one key or a toolbar button; `Esc` leaves. While active, over an image item:

| Input                      | Effect                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| move                       | Loupe (unsmoothed pixels around the cursor) and color chip follow the pointer |
| `C`                        | Copy the color in the selected format                                         |
| `1` / `2`                  | Show the horizontal / vertical run under the cursor with its length           |
| wheel while a run is shown | Change the tolerance                                                          |
| click while a run is shown | Pin it as a `measure` annotation                                              |
| `Shift`                    | Measure the outer size (scan outward from both edges of the run)              |

Keys are ignored when a text field or a modal dialog has focus. Each key has a visible
control in the Inspect bar.

**Pixel buffer.** One `Uint8ClampedArray` per image item, decoded once through a canvas
created with an explicit `colorSpace`, kept while the item is on the canvas. M0 decides
whether the buffer is read in `display-p3` or `srgb`; whichever it is, conversion to the
other space happens exactly once, in one module with reference-vector tests.

**Scan.** From the cursor, step along the axis while the pixel is within the tolerance of the
**starting** pixel (per-channel maximum difference). Comparing with the start, not the
neighbor, keeps a gradient from being walked end to end.

### 4. Colors panel

Count colors in a worker after dropping the low bits of each channel (quantization), merge
bins whose representatives are closer than a threshold in OKLab, and show each group with its
share of the image and its exact most-frequent member. Clicking a swatch dims the image and
highlights the pixels in that group. The use case is spotting two near-identical values (two
whites) and seeing which region uses which.

### 5. Text recognition

```ts
interface TextRecognizer {
  recognize(png: Buffer): Promise<RecognizedWord[] | "unavailable">;
}
interface RecognizedWord {
  text: string;
  rect: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number }; // source pixels, top-left origin
  line: number;                                          // reading order
  confidence: number;
}
```

- **macOS:** a Swift helper (`native/text-recognition/main.swift`) built and shipped like
  `native/encoded-capture` (`swiftc`, universal, `resources/native`, `asarUnpack`). It reads a
  PNG path, prints versioned JSON, and is run with a timeout. Vision returns normalized,
  bottom-left boxes; the helper converts to top-left source pixels.
- **Windows:** `Windows.Media.Ocr`, reached without a compiled module if M0 shows it is
  viable (the window list already runs through a PowerShell script).
- Output is validated with a Zod schema; anything else is `"unavailable"`.

**Selecting text.** In the editor, recognized words are hit targets over the image. Dragging
selects a range in reading order, shown as highlights; copy puts the text on the clipboard.

**Hiding text (M9).** In the redact tool, hovering a recognized line outlines it; a click
creates a redaction over its box grown by a small margin, in the strong blur or `solid` style.

**As built in M8 (NIW2-705).** macOS only, behind `image-text`; it also works in the classic editor, whose saves delete the cache. The helper
reads the PNG on stdin instead of a path; the timeout is 45 s; the cache keys each asset by the
sha256 of the bytes recognized; selection is a **Select text** tool, so dragging elsewhere keeps
moving annotations. Details in ADR 0055's Implementation status.

### 6. Flags

`image-inspect`, `image-canvas`, `image-text`, added to `FLAG_NAMES` in `shared/analytics.ts`
with offline default off. `image-canvas` is removed once one-image parity and editable saves
pass owner QA; the canvas is then the only editor.
